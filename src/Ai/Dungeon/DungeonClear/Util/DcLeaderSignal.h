    // --- Raid / multi-tank leadership ---------------------------------------
    // Elects the single tank that drives the clear for the whole group. A party
    // has one tank, but a raid can have several (one per sub-group); without a
    // single elected leader every tank would try to drive and each sub-group's
    // members would trail their own tank instead of one raid leader. The
    // candidate set is the alive tank BOTS on `reference`'s map (real-player
    // tanks are skipped — no PlayerbotAI to run the driving AI), and the winner
    // is chosen by group kind:
    //   * Party (5-man): the lowest-GUID candidate — a deterministic, state-free
    //     pick every member computes identically.
    //   * Raid: the candidate flagged Main Tank (MEMBER_FLAG_MAINTANK) wins
    //     outright; with no MT flagged (or the flagged member not an eligible tank
    //     bot), the candidate with the highest equipped gear score wins,
    //     GUID-tiebroken — the most survivable tank to hold raid-wide threat.
    // Either way every member computes the same result (GetFirstMember walks the
    // whole raid, not just a sub-group), so they all agree on whom to follow.
    // Returns nullptr when no tank bot is present on the map. `reference` may be
    // any group member: the issuing player, a follower, or a tank itself.

    // True when `bot` is the elected dungeon-clear leader for its group (see
    // FindLeaderTank). Only the leader runs the driving trigger ladder and owns

    // AND non-leader (off-)tanks alike — follows it via the follow-tank trigger.
    static bool IsDungeonClearLeader(Player* bot);

    // True when `bot` belongs to a dungeon-clear run that is currently PAUSED —
    // either it is the elected leader and its own run is paused, or it is a
    // follower whose elected leader's run is paused. Reads the leader's
    // enabled+paused flags cross-context (same pattern as DungeonClearPartyTankValue).
    //
    // Unlike the "dungeon clear party tank" value — which deliberately resolves
    // to null while paused so followers STOP trailing the leader and revert to
    // the player — this stays true through a pause. The loot-floor filter (see
    // DungeonClearFilterLootTrigger) uses it so DC's loot policy keeps applying
    // to the WHOLE party while paused: without it, paused followers fall back to
    // the stock playerbots loot pipeline, grab below-floor junk, and keep
    // IsAnyPartyMemberLooting true — which stalls the tank.

    // Caverns' return-fall off Verdan's shelf). A follower's MoveFollow toward the
    // now-far-below tank can't find a navmesh route and produces a degenerate path
    // that clips the follower straight down through the hole wall; while this is
    // true the follow-tank action HOLDS the follower at the ledge top instead. The
    // leader teleports the whole party to the landing once it lands (the DropInHole
    // RunStep gate), at which point this flips false and the party follows again.
    // Derived live from the leader's event progress (the active step is a
    // DropInHole and the leader has not yet landed) — no manual flag to go stale.

    // True when `bot` is a non-leader follower whose elected leader is running
    // advanced-pull mode with a camp marked — in which case, in pull mode, the
    // party HOLDS at the camp and leapfrogs camp-to-camp instead of following the
    // tank (which would trail it forward into every pull). Writes the leader's
    // current camp to `campOut` and whether the party must be PASSIVE right now to
    // `passiveOut` (true only during the holding pull phases Forming/Advancing/
    // Returning; outside those the party holds at camp but stays ready to defend).

    // True when `bot` is a non-leader follower whose elected leader tank is in
    // the advanced-pull camp fight RIGHT NOW: pull phase Engage (the pack has
    // been dragged back and handed to stock combat) AND the leader is actually in
    // combat. This is the window in which a released follower must pile into the
    // pack even if the drag parked it out of the camp's line of sight (around a
    // corner) — where the stock LOS-gated target picker never acquires a target
    // and the party would otherwise stand idle and never enter the fight. Drives
    // DungeonClearAssistCamp{,Combat}Trigger. Returns false (the common case) for
    // the leader, outside pull mode, or when the leader isn't mid camp-fight.
    static bool IsLeaderCampFightActive(Player* bot);

    // The GENERAL "tank is fighting -> the party assists" gate: true when `bot`'s
    // elected leader tank is in combat on an active (enabled, unpaused) run and
    // the party is expected to pile in RIGHT NOW. Includes the advanced-pull camp
    // fight (IsLeaderCampFightActive), but ALSO every fight the camp machinery
    // does not own: pull mode off, a Leeroy verdict in dynamic mode, boss
    // walk-ins, and unplanned aggro outside a camp hold. This is what covers a
    // tank that aggros around a corner or beyond a follower's natural engage
    // range — group combat never propagates that far, and DC's multiplier mutes
    // the stock proactive pickers, so without this push the party stands idle
    // while the tank solos. Defers (false) while an advanced-pull camp hold is
    // in effect outside the camp fight: the holding phases pin the party passive
    // and an Idle-phase aggro is dragged back to camp first. False for the
    // leader itself, off/paused runs, or a leader out of combat. Drives
    // DungeonClearAssistCamp{,Combat}Trigger.
    static bool IsLeaderFightAssistWanted(Player* bot);

    // The MIRROR of IsLeaderFightAssistWanted for the LEADER itself: true when
    // `bot` IS the elected leader tank, is OUT of combat on an active (enabled,
    // unpaused) run, has no engage target of its own in sight, yet a groupmate is
    // (latched) in combat. This is the case the followers' assist gate can't cover
    // because it bails for the leader: the tank declared the pull done and started
    // advancing — or a follower aggroed a pack around a sharp corner the tank
    // never saw — so the tank stands frozen on the Advance rest gate ("party not
    // ready / resting") while the DPS fight without it. Drives the tank back onto
    // the party's fight to take threat. Defers (false) while a pull maneuver is
    // holding the party at camp (the drag owns the tank's positioning) and while
    // the tank already has its own visible attacker (its engage scan handles
    // that). Uses the same PartyCombatLatch hysteresis as the followers' gate so
    // both sides ride out the combat-flicker TOCTOU consistently. Drives
    // DungeonClearLeaderAssistTrigger.
    static bool IsLeaderShouldAssistFight(Player* bot);

    // True when `bot`'s elected leader is running DYNAMIC pull (pull setting == 2)
    // and is still scouting/deciding the next pack — i.e. out of combat with the
    // pull phase Idle, before it has committed to a Leeroy or an Advanced camp.
    // This is the window in which the party must hang BACK so it doesn't trail the
    // tank into an accidental aggro before the verdict is in; DungeonClearFollow
    // TankAction widens its follow distance (PullDynamicPartyLag) while it holds.
    // The instant the tank commits (enters combat, or an Advanced camp is marked),
    // this returns false and the party reverts to the tight follow / camp hold.
    // Returns false for the leader itself, outside dynamic mode, or off/paused.
    static bool IsLeaderDynamicScouting(Player* bot);

    // Point `lag` yards back along the LEADER tank's breadcrumb trail (the ground
    // the tank actually walked, which the escort spline already corridor-centered),
    // for a follower to trail to during dynamic scouting. Walking the leader's
    // trail keeps followers on the centered route instead of bee-lining a geometric
    // lag point through the raw PathGenerator, which hugs walls and ledges. Reads

    // crumb `bot` can reach over a complete generated path. False if there is no
    // leader, the trail is empty, or no reachable point lies far enough back.

    // Multi-point variant of GetLeaderScoutTrailPoint: the centered breadcrumb
    // POLYLINE a follower should glide to catch up to the tank, rather than the
    // single crumb the point variant returns. `out` is filled with the spline
    // window [follower live pos, ...intermediate crumbs..., the crumb `lag` yards
    // behind the tank] in forward (toward-tank) order, ready to hand to
    // DcMovement::SplinePath. This lets followers ride ONE continuous escort
    // spline along the centered trail instead of re-issuing a per-tick single-
    // point MoveTo to each crumb — the per-crumb relaunch made followers visibly
    // half-step (accel/decel at every waypoint), the same stutter the tank's
    // advance shed when it moved to MoveSplinePath. The window only spans from
    // the follower up to the lag crumb (never up to the tank), so the glide
    // preserves the lag instead of closing it. Reachability of the entry leg is
    // probed (one PathGenerator build, as the point variant does); the rest of
    // the window is the tank's own contiguous walked ground. Returns false (out
    // cleared) when there is no leader, the trail is empty, the follower is at or
    // ahead of the lag crumb (nothing to glide — caller falls back to the point
    // step / Follow fan), the follower is too far off-trail for a safe entry leg,
    // or fewer than two window points result.

    // --- Room-aggro clear ----------------------------------------------------
    // True when `bot`'s elected leader tank is mid room-aggro clear (a flagged
    // RoomAggroRegistry boss with room trash still to clear, the tank at the boss
    // room) — the window in which the tank skirts the boss's aggro sphere on its
    // own approach (DungeonClearEngageActionBase::RoomAggroSkirtPoint). Writes the
    // LIVE boss centre to `centerOut` and the avoid-sphere radius (the boss's real
    // aggro range for THIS follower + both reaches + AggroRangeMargin +
    // RoomAggroPathPadding — the same sizing the tank's skirt uses) to `radiusOut`.
    // Followers read this so their close-follow to the tank can detour AROUND the
    // sphere instead of cutting a straight line through it: the tank dodges the
    // boss correctly, but a follower bee-lining to a tank parked on the far side of
    // the sphere would otherwise run the party into aggro and wake the room. Reads
    // the leader's context cross-bot (same pattern as IsLeaderDynamicScouting);

    // loaded.

    // speed) — which cripples the pull-to-camp drag-back exactly when the tank
    // most needs to retreat (it is running AWAY from the pack, so every hit
    // lands from behind). We "cheat a little" per design and make the driving
    // tank daze-proof while pull mode is on. Idempotent; also strips any Daze
