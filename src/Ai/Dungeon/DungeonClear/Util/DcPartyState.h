    // whenever the camp standoff (PullSetback, safe-camp/LOS extensions up to
    // PullMaxDrag) reaches PartyMaxSpread: the gate can't pass, so the pull
    // trigger never fires, so the camp never advances, so the party never gets
    // any closer — tank and party wait on each other forever. "Caught up" in
    // pull mode means "set at the camp they were told to hold", so the spread is
