    //      a pillar or wall between the camp and the mob means it never pulls.

    //      pairs 12-17yd apart (well inside aggro reach) do NOT chain because the
    //      pillars block sight; gating on LOS keeps those a 2-mob Leeroy instead of
    //      counting six through the stone. (This is the opposite choice from the old
    //      pack-adjacency model, which deliberately ignored LOS because it asked a
    //      different question — "will this pack drag in as the MOVING tank rounds the
    //      corner". The estimate asks "who aggros a fight that stays put", and for
    //      that, sight is exactly the right test.)
    //   2. No closed door between (VMAP LOS treats an open door's frame as clear and
    //      a shut door is a game object, not static geometry, so doors need their
    //      own test).
    //   3. Navmesh connectivity: a complete PATHFIND_NORMAL route within a
    //      corner-slack budget, so a mob that is visible across an unwalkable gap
    //      (a chasm, a ledge) and could never join the melee does not count.
    //
    // Formation/linked packmates bypass this gate entirely — they pull atomically
    // by packId (seed + closure), so a formation member behind a pillar still
    // counts. The gate only decides whether an UNRELATED neighbour aggros.
