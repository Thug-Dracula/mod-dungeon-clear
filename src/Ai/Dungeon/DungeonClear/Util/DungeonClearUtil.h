    // (normal kill loot) and treasure CHESTS. Every other lootable interactable

    // gathering nodes (chest-type gameobjects gated by a profession-skill lock),
    // skinnable-only corpses, fishing holes, levers, quest objects and loose
    // item loot. Anything that isn't a corpse-with-takeable-loot or a real chest
    // is skipped on sight.
    //
    // Drains EVERY in-range unworthy corpse in one call, not just the nearest:
    // it re-evaluates the now-nearest pickup after each skip and repeats until
    // the nearest is worth a stop (or there is none left). This keeps the tank
    // from stutter-stopping once per skipped corpse when it backtracks through a
    // field of below-floor corpses — with all of them stripped in a single tick,
    // "has available loot" never stays armed for loot the bot won't take, so the
    // advance walks straight through, held only by the party-spread gate.
    //
    // A corpse is skipped when it holds nothing this bot can take, which is two
    // overlapping cases:
    //   - un-finishable: every unlooted item is locked in a group-loot roll the
    //     bot has not won (won items are auto-delivered, never re-looted),
    //     reserved for another looter, disallowed for the bot, or the bags are
    //     full — and there is no claimable gold.
    //   - below policy: no unlooted item meets DungeonClear.LootMinQuality (an
    //     ITEM_QUALITY_* floor). Quest / quest-starter items always qualify.
    //     A floor above 0 also stops gold alone from earning a detour, so the
    //     floor actually reduces the number of stops; floor 0 (default)
    //     preserves stock "loot everything" behaviour.
    //
    // The corpse-quality check is deliberately conservative — it skips a corpse
    // only when confident nothing is takeable — because a false skip drops real
    // loot, whereas a missed skip merely falls back to the existing timeout.
